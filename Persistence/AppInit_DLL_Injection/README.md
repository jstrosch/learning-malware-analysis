# AppInit_DLLs Injection

`inject.c` is a simple DLL application that is meant to imitate a malicious DLL. It currently just pops a message box for PoC purposes.

`Appinit_dllsinjection.c` is an executable that changes the respective `AppsInit_DLLs` registry subkeys, including:

* `AppInit_DLLs` which points to our *malicious* DLL path
* `LoadAppInit_DLLs` which is set to *1* in order to allow the system to load AppInit DLLs
* `RequireSignedAppInit_DLLs` which is set to *0* in order to avoid allowing only signed DLLs to be loaded

By doing this, we force the system to load our DLL into every process that loads `User32.dll` which means a majority of processes that are executed on a system will load our *malicious* DLL file & execute our code!
